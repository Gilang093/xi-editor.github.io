## Frontends

Here are some front-ends in various stages of development:

* [xi-mac](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-mac), the official macOS front-end.

* [fuchsia/xi](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/master/bin/xi/), a front-end in Flutter for Fuchsia.

* [xi-gtk](https://github.com/eyelash/xi-gtk), a GTK+ front-end.

* [xi-term](https://github.com/xi-frontend/xi-term), a text UI.

* [xi-electron](https://github.com/acheronfail/xi-electron), a cross-platform front-end based on web-technologies.

* [Tau](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Tau), a GTK+ front-end written in Rust. Forked from https://github.com/bvinc/gxi, which was abandoned.

* [xi-win](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-win), an experimental Windows front-end written in Rust.

* [kod](https://github.com/linde12/kod), a terminal frontend written in Golang.

* [xi-qt](https://github.com/sw5cc/xi-qt), a Qt front-end.

* [vixi](https://github.com/Peltoche/vixi), a Vim like front-end in Rust.

The following are currently inactive, based on earlier versions of the front-end
protocol, but perhaps could be revitalized:

* [xi_glium](https://github.com/potocpav/xi_glium), an
experimental GL-based front-end in Rust.

* [XiEditorVS2015](https://github.com/Sineaggi/XiEditorVS2015), C#.

* [xi-android](https://github.com/adrientetar/xi-android), an Android frontend.
